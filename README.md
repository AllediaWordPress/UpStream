# UpStream
Project Management for WordPress that is powerful, extensible & easy to use. Manage projects, clients, milestones, tasks, files & more.

## Development
### Git
First of all, make sure your local-git setting `ignorecase` is set to `false`.

To change it localy, run:
```
$ cd <path-to-your-local-repository>
$ git config core.ignorecase false
```

In case you want to change it globally instead:
```
$ cd <path-to-your-local-repository>
$ git config --global core.ignorecase false
```

Alternatively, you can change manually editing git config file, which can be found here:
```
<path-to-your-local-repository>/.git/config
```
