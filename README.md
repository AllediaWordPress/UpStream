## Contributing
Hey, thats awesome! Feel free to contribute in any way, submiting bug reports, features requests, forking and sending pull requests.

### Bug Reports
A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, and shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report, like what would you expect to be the outcome, what steps will reproduce the issue, what is your environment like.

### Pull Requests
The `master` branch always reflects a production-ready state while the latest development is taking place in the `development` branch.

Only pull requests to the `development` branch will be reviewed and merged.

### Git Settings
Ensure that your local-git setting `ignorecase` is set to `false`.

To change it localy, run:
```
$ cd <path-to-your-local-repository>
$ git config core.ignorecase false
```

In case you want to change it globally instead:
```
$ cd <path-to-your-local-repository>
$ git config --global core.ignorecase false
```

Alternatively, you can change manually editing git config file, which can be found here:
```
<path-to-your-local-repository>/.git/config
```
